# hello-world
First project on github
My name is Paige, and I have been interested in coding for a while. I took a coding class my freshman year in college, though I went through some issues and lost interest in school. However, I am back, and more interested than ever, to find out what it means to learn coding and involve myself into this coding community. I am starting alone for now, as I have no confidence in my skills, but I will emerge one day and make my mark!
